                    <h1 class="text">Ben Carson went from being a poor student to receiving academic honors 
                       and eventually attending medical school. As a doctor, 
                       he became director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital at age 33 
                       and earned fame for his groundbreaking work separating conjoined twins. He retired
                       from medicine in 2013, and two years later he entered politics, 
                       making a bid to become the Republican candidate for U.S. president.
                      Carson dropped out of the race in March 2016 and became a vocal supporter of Republican nominee Donald Trump,
                      eventually earning selection as President Trump's secretary of 
                       the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
